Usage \u00b6 Before setting up the plugin, set site_url to the url of your published site: mkdocs.yml site_url : https://liang2kl.github.io/mkdocs-blogging-plugin/ Add blogging in plugins and specify the directories to be included: mkdocs.yml plugins : - blogging : dirs : # The directories to be included - blog In the page you want to insert the blog content, just add a line {{ blog_content }} into your desired place: blog index page # Blogs {{ blog_content }} Optionally, in your articles, add meta tags providing their titles and descriptions, which will be displayed on the blog page: article --- title: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet description: Nullam urna elit, malesuada eget finibus ut, ac tortor. --- Additionally, you can also set tags for all articles, which can be access on certain pages. First, turn on this feature in the configuration: mkdocs.yml plugins : - blogging : features : tags : {} And in articles: article --- tags: - mkdocs - blogging --- For more detail, check Features - tags . To exclude certain pages from the blog collection, add a meta tag exculde_from_blog in the meta section of the markdown file: article --- exculde_from_blog: true --- And it's done! You can open the page where you insert {{ blog_content }} and see how it is working. Options \u00b6 Configure the plugin via following options: mkdocs.yml theme : # Use a predefined theme name : card features : # Additional features tags : ... size : 5 # Number of articles in one page, default: 10 locale : en # The locale for time localizations, default: system's locale time_format : '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S' # The format used to display the time meta_time_format : '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S' # The format used to parse the time from meta sort : from : new # Sort from new to old, default # or old # Sort from old to new by : creation # Sort by the first commit time, default # or revision # Sort by the latest commit time paging : false # Disable paging show_total : false # Remove 'total pages' label template : blog-override.html # Path to customized template These parameters deserve special care: time_format is used to change the display style of the time, with higher priority than locale . meta_time_format is used to tell the plugin how to parse the given time string from the meta. When meta_time_format is set, for all posts with a time or date metadata, the plugin will use this format to parse the that time, and replace the time from git logs. This is useful to alter specific posts' time where git commit time is not accurate or desired. See the list of datetime placeholders . When paging is set to false , if size is not set, all posts will be displayed on the first page; otherwise the first size posts will be displayed and the rest will not . For more about themes and custom templates, see Themes and Template respectively.
